# Lecture 2: Your First Angular Application

## Objective:
- Create a new Angular 16 project.
- Understand the folder structure of an Angular project.
- Learn how to run the Angular development server.

## Instructions:

### 1. **Creating a New Angular Project**
- Open the terminal and make sure you have Angular CLI installed. If not, you can install it by running:
  ```bash
  npm install -g @angular/cli
* Create a new Angular project by running the following command:
Bash

ng new first-angular-app
* Follow the prompts to choose routing (you can choose 'No') and stylesheet format (CSS, SCSS, etc.).
2. Understanding the Folder Structure
Once the project is created, you'll notice the following folder structure:
bash

first-angular-app/
??? e2e/                      # End-to-end testing files
??? node_modules/             # Node modules dependencies
??? src/                      # The source code of the application
?   ??? app/                  # Contains components, services, etc.
?   ??? assets/               # Static files (images, fonts, etc.)
?   ??? environments/         # Environment-specific configurations
?   ??? index.html            # Main HTML page for the app
??? angular.json              # Angular project configuration
??? package.json              # Project dependencies and scripts
??? tsconfig.json             # TypeScript configuration
3. Running the Angular Development Server
* To view your Angular application, run the development server by executing:
bash

cd first-angular-app
ng serve
* The application will be available at http://localhost:4200/ in your browser. Open your browser and navigate to this URL to see the default Angular welcome page.
