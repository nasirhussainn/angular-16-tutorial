# Lecture 3: Angular Components

## Objective:
- Understand what Angular components are.
- Learn how to create and use components in Angular.
- Explore component lifecycle hooks and bindings.

## Instructions:

### 1. **What is a Component?**
In Angular, a component is a fundamental building block. Each component consists of three main parts:
- **Template:** HTML that defines the structure of the view.
- **Class:** Contains the logic and properties of the component.
- **Style:** CSS that defines the visual appearance of the component.

### 2. **Creating and Using Components**
- Open the terminal and navigate to the Angular project directory.
- To generate a new component, use the Angular CLI:
  ```bash
  ng generate component my-first-component
After running the command, Angular CLI will create four files for the component:

perl
src/app/my-first-component/
  ├── my-first-component.component.ts
  ├── my-first-component.component.html
  ├── my-first-component.component.css
  └── my-first-component.component.spec.ts
Update the my-first-component.component.ts class to define a message property:

typescript
export class MyFirstComponentComponent {
  message = 'Hello, Angular 16!';
}
In the my-first-component.component.html, display the message:

html

<h2>{{ message }}</h2>
Finally, to display the component, open src/app/app.component.html and add:

html

<app-my-first-component></app-my-first-component>
3. Component Lifecycle Hooks and Bindings
Angular components go through several lifecycle hooks, such as:

ngOnInit(): Called after Angular has initialized the component's data-bound properties.
ngOnChanges(): Called when an input property changes.
ngOnDestroy(): Called when Angular destroys the component.
These lifecycle hooks can be used to manage the component's behavior and resources efficiently.

In the MyFirstComponentComponent, you can add the ngOnInit() lifecycle hook as follows:

typescript

import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-my-first-component',
  templateUrl: './my-first-component.component.html',
  styleUrls: ['./my-first-component.component.css']
})
export class MyFirstComponentComponent implements OnInit {
  message = 'Hello, Angular 16!';

  ngOnInit(): void {
    console.log('Component initialized!');
  }
}
4. Running the Application
To view your new component, run the application:

bash
ng serve
Open your browser and visit http://localhost:4200/ to see your component in action.
