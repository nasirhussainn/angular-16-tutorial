# Lecture 7: API Integration with HttpClient Module

## Overview:
In this lecture, we will learn how to integrate an API using Angular's `HttpClientModule`. We'll cover the following key concepts:

- **Error handling and data management**

## Steps Covered:
### 1. Setup `HttpClientModule`
To use Angular's HttpClient, you need to import the `HttpClientModule` in your applicationâ€™s module.

#### **app.module.ts**

```typescript
import { HttpClientModule } from '@angular/common/http';  // Import HttpClientModule

@NgModule({
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  imports: [BrowserModule, HttpClientModule],  // Add HttpClientModule to imports
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})
export class AppModule {}
```
